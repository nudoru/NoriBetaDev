For converting to AICC:

Use details from the course implementation form to fill out the 4 aicc files.
Rename the aicc files to use the true course code of the course.
copy all of these files to the root folder of the course (one level up from this one)
edit the "engine.xml" file and set the LMS type from SCORM to AICC
